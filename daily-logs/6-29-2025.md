## Project Progress

### New Project: Streaming Kafka Spark
Started my second project in the data-engineering-journey repository today - a streaming data pipeline using Kafka and Spark.

#### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created basic folder structure for `streaming-kafka-spark` project
- ✅ Finalized tech stack selection
- ✅ Conducted initial research on streaming architectures
- ✅ Set up project foundation

#### Tech Stack Decisions
**Core Technologies:**
- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Apache Spark** - Distributed data processing engine
- **Apache Kafka** - Event streaming platform
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container orchestration
- **Poetry** - Python dependency management

#### Research Insights
Spent time researching best practices for streaming data pipelines and the integration patterns between Kafka and Spark. Key areas explored:
- Kafka producer/consumer patterns
- Spark Structured Streaming capabilities
- Containerization strategies for distributed systems
- Data serialization formats (Avro, JSON, Protobuf)

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Set up Poetry configuration and dependencies
- [ ] Create Docker Compose file for Kafka cluster
- [ ] Implement basic Kafka producer
- [ ] Design Spark streaming job structure
- [ ] Define data flow architecture

## Learnings
- Understanding the complexity of setting up a proper streaming infrastructure
- Importance of choosing the right serialization format for streaming data
- Docker Compose is essential for managing multi-service streaming applications

## Challenges
- Deciding on the optimal Kafka cluster configuration for development
- Balancing between simplicity and real-world applicability in the project design

## Time Spent
Approximately 3-4 hours on project setup and research
