## 🎯 Today's Accomplishments

### ✅ Work Tasks
- **Status**: All assigned tasks completed successfully
- **Productivity**: High - finished everything on schedule

### 📚 Learning Progress - SQL

#### **SQL Basics Covered:**
- **SELECT Statement**: Basic data retrieval, column selection, aliases
- **WHERE Clause**: Filtering data with conditions, AND/OR operators
- **ORDER BY**: Sorting results in ascending/descending order
- **DISTINCT**: Removing duplicate values from results
- **LIMIT**: Restricting number of rows returned
- **IN Clause**: Matching values against lists
- **BETWEEN**: Filtering data within ranges
- **SQL Query Execution Order**: Understanding how queries are processed internally

#### **SQL Intermediate Concepts Learned:**
- **GROUP BY**: Grouping rows for aggregate operations
- **HAVING**: Filtering grouped results (vs WHERE for individual rows)
- **Aggregate Functions**: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN()
- **SQL JOINS**: 
  - INNER JOIN (matching rows only)
  - LEFT JOIN (all left + matching right)
  - RIGHT JOIN (all right + matching left)  
  - FULL OUTER JOIN (all rows from both tables)
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries in SELECT, FROM, WHERE clauses
- **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()
- **CASE Statements**: Conditional logic in SQL
- **NULL Handling**: COALESCE(), NULLIF() functions

#### **Key Learning Insights:**
- Understood SQL query execution order (FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY → LIMIT)
- Practiced difference between WHERE (filters rows) vs HAVING (filters groups)
- Learned when to use different JOIN types based on data requirements
- Gained hands-on experience with window functions for ranking and analytics

## 📈 Progress Summary
- **SQL Skill Level**: Basics ✅ → Intermediate ✅
- **Work Performance**: All tasks completed on time
- **Learning Momentum**: Strong - ready for advanced SQL concepts

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Continue to advanced SQL topics (CTEs, advanced window functions, performance optimization)
- Apply learned concepts to real-world data engineering scenarios
- Practice complex queries combining multiple intermediate concepts
