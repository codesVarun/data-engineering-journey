# Data Engineering Journey - Daily Log
## June 10, 2025

### Today's Focus
I was busy completing tasks assigned to me on my Kanban story, so I wasn't able to dedicate much time to learning data engineering. However, I still managed to make some progress on my learning journey.

### Accomplishments
- ‚úÖ Completed the LeetCode study plan: **"Introduction to Pandas"**
- üèÖ Received a LeetCode medal for completing the study plan
- üìö Gained hands-on knowledge about Pandas fundamentals

### Learning Notes
Started diving deeper into Pandas as part of my data engineering learning path. The LeetCode study plan provided practical experience with:
- Basic Pandas operations
- Data manipulation techniques
- Core concepts for data engineering workflows

### Reflection
Even with limited time due to work commitments, completing the Pandas introduction study plan was a solid step forward. The hands-on practice through LeetCode problems helped reinforce the theoretical concepts I've been studying.

### Next Steps
- Continue exploring advanced Pandas operations
- Apply Pandas knowledge to real data engineering scenarios
- Balance work tasks with consistent learning progress
