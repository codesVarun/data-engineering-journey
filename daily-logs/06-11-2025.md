## Project Progress: ETL Pipeline COVID API

Today I implemented data visualization functionality into the etl-pipeline-covid-api project using:
- **Streamlit** - for creating the web interface
- **Plotly** - for interactive data visualizations

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with Streamlit framework
- Explored Streamlit's capabilities for rapid web app development
- Integrated Plotly visualizations with Streamlit interface

## Time Investment

Due to office working day commitments, dedicated lesser time to this repository today. However, managed to make meaningful progress on the visualization component of the project.

## Next Steps

- Continue expanding visualization features
- Optimize the Streamlit app performance
- Add more interactive elements to the dashboard
