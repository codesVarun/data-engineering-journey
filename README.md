# 🛠️ Data Engineering Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Engineering Journey** repository — a living portfolio and documentation of everything I learn and build as a data engineer. This repo is updated daily with new learnings, notes, hands-on projects, and tips across the full data engineering stack.

---

## 📅 Daily Logs

All daily learnings are tracked in the [`daily-logs/`](./daily-logs) folder, organized by date. Example:
- [2025-06-08.md](./daily-logs/2025-06-08.md) – Learned about Kafka architecture and implemented a producer/consumer setup locally.
